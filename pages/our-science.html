                    We are in-licensing IP and Technology for our first regenerative medicine portfolio which has led to
                    approval of commercially marketed therapeutics in India for three different indications:
                    Osteo-Arthritis (OA) of the knee; and Critical Limb Ischemia due to Buergerâ€™s Disease and
                    Atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease. Our technology licensing partner has recently completed
                    randomized blinded phase 3 trial for a fourth indication of Diabetic Foot Ulcers at Plantar location
                    and is currently unblinding / analyzing the data. All four products are derived from a robust,
                    scalable, pooled allogeneic bone-marrow derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cell (MSC) therapy platform.
                    Pooling overcomes limitation of Product made from individual donors, resulting in homogeneous
                    characteristics with ability to expand in prolonged culture while maintaining trilineage
                    differentiation potential resulting in manufacture of significantly larger number of Doses from
                    single starting GMP cell bank; with said Drug Product having desired potency, as measured by strong
                    immuno-modulatory bioactivity and broad cytokine / growth factors secretion profile, and thereby
                    resulting in durable clinically-meaningful efficacy outcomes. The Drug Product is hypothesized to
                    work via mechanisms of immunomodulation of disease environment to halt / reverse progression of
                    disease and create a quasi-niche to facilitate regeneration of lost / damaged cells & tissues.
